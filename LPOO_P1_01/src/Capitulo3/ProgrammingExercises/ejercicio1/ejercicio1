1.Suppose that you have created a program with only the following variables:
int v = 4;
int w = 6;
double x = 2.2;

Suppose that you also have a method with the following header: public static void calculate(int x, double y) Which of the following method calls are legal?

a. calculate(v, w);      A) Valido             d. calculate(18, x);                 D) Valido
b. calculate(v, x);      B) Valido             e. calculate(1.1, 2.2);              E) Invalido
c. calculate(x, y);      C) Invalido           f. calculate(5, 7);                  F) Valido
